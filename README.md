# PathTracer

A GLSL PathTracer based on Compute Shaders with the goal to perform light transport simulation, to achieve realistic rendered images.\
I don't have intention to further implement features for this project, but I hope that this may be useful to anyone.\
This project has been tested on a RTX 3060 Laptop, and has been programmed according to Nvidia's OpenGL requirements.\
This project was made for my Bachelor Thesis at ITU Copenhagen for Software Development.

## Controls

Space to enable movement

WASD to move around

Shift to speed up

Mouse to look around
